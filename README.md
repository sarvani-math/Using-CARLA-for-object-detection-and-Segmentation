# Using-CARLA-for-object-detection-and-Segmentation
Used the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement drivable space estimation in 3D, implement lane estimation, and filter out unreliable estimates in the output of 2D object detectors.
Used the filtered 2D object detection output to determine how far obstacles are from the self-driving car.
